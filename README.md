# ðŸš€ Web3 NextJS Starter

This is a Web3 [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) starter app.

We use [ConnectKit](https://family.co/docs/connectkit), [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), [Viem](https://viem.sh/) and [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/).

The app is configured for a simple Railway deployment as a Service Template.
